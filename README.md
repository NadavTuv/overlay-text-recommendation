# Image Overlay Text Recommendation Project

## Overview

This project focuses on automating the process of recommending overlay text and captions for images uploaded to social media. The system utilizes instance segmentation to identify objects in images and leverages the ChatGPT API for generating text suggestions. While the project is in its early stages, the goal is to refine and expand its capabilities, including font selection and text placement on images.

## Project Structure
